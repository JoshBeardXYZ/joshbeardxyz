Welcome to my personal website, created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal sites like this. Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which I use to host this site from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JoshBeardXYZ/joshbeardxyz).

## Jekyll Now

If you'd like to get started on a personal site of your own, I highly recommend [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Barry Clark does an excellent job in this detailed walkthrough, [Build a Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), on the Smashing Magazine website.

I followed his guide to get this site up and running. Since then, I continue to learn about Git, HTML, and Markdown as I develop the site locally.

In October of 2018 I added Disqus comments to the Blog posts.

## Inspiration

I am amazed and inspired by talented makers with incredible personal sites. As a Marketer, I have immense respect for designers and developers. It was inspiring to see some of the work being done today and learn from it.
