I have always been interested in Website Development and SEO; specifically with Google Search and how to stay relevant. As a small business with one Marketing employee (me), these nuances were not “low-hanging fruit” and frequently fell to the wayside.

However, I always kept my eye on this area and did the bare minimum to stay mobile-friendly and relevant in the eyes of Google.

&nbsp;

## Getting Mobile-Friendly

As an Associate at Transmet Corporation, I informed the IT group of the Google Mobile-Friendly “Mobilegeddon” in 2015, sparking a redesign of the website. This also included a spot of “This Site is Hacked” and finding spam hidden deep in our website code.

&nbsp;

## Implementing SEO Best Practices

After being promoted to Marketing Manager in 2016, I took on increased responsibility for our WordPress website.

I made a point to spend a short period getting our website up to speed with my knowledge. This was not something I did full-time as an Associate and an IT group managed most of it. I narrowed the outline of our site and removed duplicate content to make it easier to read, both by users and by Google.

**In the final months of 2016 leading into 2017:**

- Removed/consolidated duplicate content
- Wrote new page titles and added missing page descriptions with [Yoast](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/)
- Revised page structure and added missing title tags
- Submitted Sitemap in Google Search Console
- Compressed/optimized Images and PDFs with [ShortPixel](https://shortpixel.com/otp/af/VNJVO5I438769)

### Organic Traffic Growth Results

In 2017, website users grew 412% (to 34K), from ~500 monthly users in January to ~9,000 in December. Total pageviews in 2017 were over 100K (328% growth).

Zoomed out to look at website users per quarter in 2015, 2016, and 2017 gives a broader look at the impact these changes had on our traffic.
