At the beginning of 2017, after a company rebrand and <a href="https://www.transmet.com/new-logo/" target="_blank" >new logo</a>, it was time to update the trade show display booth in use for over a decade. This booth traveled with our Sales Engineer to 4-5 shows every year and sees thousands of show attendees.

## Before and After

Our goal was to focus on the new logo and surround it with product photography. The backlit 8' x 10' display would attract the eye more than the charts and text that covered the old booth. Below is a before and after picture of the booth.

### Project Partners

This was one of the larger projects I had handled as Marketing Manager at Transmet Corporation and I could not have done it without my project partners.

A big *thank you* to [Skyline Exhibits of Central Ohio](https://www.skyline.com/exhibits-columbus-dayton) for the quality display, great service, and guidance throughout. Thank you to [Jenna Kendle](http://www.jennakendle.com) for the graphic design work and creative direction. This was a very large file to work with and we could not have done it without her. Thank you to [Nick Fancher](http://nickfancher.com) in Columbus, Ohio for the product photography.

Below is the final proof sent for print.
