Main idea for the Transmet Email Subscriber Newsletter in 2017: **Quality, not quantity**.

We moved from iContact to <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/pardot/overview/" target="_blank" >Pardot</a> to better integrate with Salesforce. I developed new templates to open anywhere and read easily, even in Outlook (*shoutout <a href="https://litmus.com/community/templates" target="_blank" >Litmus</a>*). One newsletter a month for one year.


## Background

As Marketing Manager at Transmet Corporation, I took over full control of the Email Marketing program they started in 2013. I had written a lot of copy and assisted with HTML Email Templates in the past, but this would be my first chance to build campaigns from start to finish.

I took the same mobile-friendly approach to Email Development as I saw working in Web Development, and made top-of-the-line email templates using industry pros like Litmus for help.

I was not comfortable sending mass emails to our entire list, unsegmented, without double-opt-in, so I didn’t. Instead, I only mailed to the leads that had interacted with us in the past.


### Data Validation

In order to be certain our emails would get delivered to people, I used D&B and Salesforce to Clean and Validate all our data. It’s known that a certain percentage of data goes stale every year and it was important to stay on top of. HuBuCo proved a great resource.
