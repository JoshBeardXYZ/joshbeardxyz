Naval Ravikant is a source of truth for me (and an excellent follow on Twitter). Shane Parrish calls him a *"deep thinker who challenges the status quo"* and this can be felt through his words.

I followed Naval a while back and (*thanks to the timeline algo*) vastly improved the quality of content on my Twitter feed.

## About Naval

Naval is an avid reader and listening to him is almost like reading one hundred books at once *(If you have not heard Shane and Naval's conversation on The Knowledge Project, [do it now](https://theknowledgeproject.libsyn.com/naval-ravikant-on-reading-happiness-systems-for-decision-making-habits-radical-honesty))*.

Podcast appearances are rare, but Twitter threads surface frequently. His most recent offered so many thought-provoking tidbits I made this post to save for later.

I picked out some of my favorite responses on advice to younger self, thinking, time vs money, relationships, reading, stress, and health.

Enjoy!

### Advice to Younger Self

**Q:** *“I’m starting my first year in college next week; how do I maximize the next four years?”*  
  **A:** Study what you can’t learn as easily on your own (STEM). Build something as part of a small team and outside of classwork. Make lifelong friends. Find an athletic activity that you love for its own sake. Avoid crowds, their activities, and their recently fashionable beliefs.

**Q:** *“One skill that a twenty-something should pick up today?”*  
  **A:** Learn to code.

**Q:** *“If you were just starting out in your 20's today, what would you do differently?”*  
  **A:** More patience, more presence, less anxiety.

**Q:** *“If you could go back and tell your younger self one thing what would it be, and why?”*  
  **A:** Relax. You’ll live longer *and* perform better.

### Thinking

**Q:** *“How do you know when to be patient vs. when to be impatient?”*  
  **A:** Impatience with actions, patience with results.

**Q:** *“What do you do to keep sane if your model of reality is not making sense?”*  
  **A:** Just change it. “Strong opinions, loosely held."

**Q:** *“How does one develop a unique view on life?”*  
  **A:** Don't listen to others.

**Q:** *“What truths did you discover that shaped your worldview?”*  
  **A:** There are no adults.

&nbsp;

### Time

**Q:** *“What’s the worst way you wasted a lot of your time?”*  
  **A:** Meetings, conferences, traveling for business, staying in relationships that I knew weren’t forever.

**Q:** *“How do you wish you spent your time ten years ago?”*  
  **A:** Time is the ultimate currency and I should have been more tight fisted with it.

**Q:** *“Would you rather have more money than time, or more time than money?”*  
  **A:** You can always convert time to money.

&nbsp;

### Relationships

**Q:** *“Do you have a philosophy for friendship vs. acquaintance?”*  
  **A:** If you can't see yourself working with someone for life, don't work with them for a day.

**Q:** *“Best piece of business advice you wish you had prior to it all?”*  
  **A:** Keep an incredibly high bar for who you work with.

**Q:** *“How do you say no gracefully?”*  
  **A:** Be honest. Your social circle will sort itself out.

**Q:** *“What’s the difference between Alone & Lonely?”*  
  **A:** Alone is a fact, lonely is a choice. We are so afraid to be alone that we end up lonely. The ability to be alone without being lonely is a superpower.

&nbsp;

### Reading

**Q:** *“Can you actually become smarter? How?”*  
  **A:** Read what you love until you love to read.

**Q:** *“What’s the best way to absorb/retain information from books you read?”*  
  **A:** Explain it to someone else or tweet about it.

**Q:** *“What is your intention when you read books/articles/blogs?”*  
  **A:** None, intentions get in the way of observation. But I enjoy and tend to stick to concise, clear, and simply written things that teach me something new.

&nbsp;

### Stress

**Q:** *“How to stay positive during debilitating sickness?”*  
  **A:** This is your opportunity for internal exploration and growth. “Every man has two lives, and the second begins when he realizes he has only one.”

**Q:** *“What’s best way to handle serious/extreme setbacks (facing health catastrophe with dad)?”*  
  **A:** Read philosophy, try yoga, meditation. These are old (Lindy) solutions.

**Q:** *“What do you do if you get stressed out and want to regain focus?”*  
  **A:** Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day.

&nbsp;

### Health

**Q:** *“Is physical health or mental health more important?”*  
  **A:** Both, but mental is the one that you have more control over and can continue to improve as you get older and older.
