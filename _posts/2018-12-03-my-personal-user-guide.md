I found this tool on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/personal-user-guide) that helps you create a Personal User Guide to help others get along with you better. According to Gijs Heerkens, "the objective of a personal user guide is to speed up trust and effective communication in your life. At your work, for job applications or during job interviews. And, why not, at home, with your partner, your friends or within your sports team."

## Josh Beard's Personal User Guide

I am someone who has a preference for new situations and ideas, but I do not start them myself. I appreciate a certain amount of variation in my work. In daily life you can see that I am:

- reasonably imaginative
- overall moderate

On the flip side I can sometimes be seen as:
- not really creative or curious

- moderately interested in art

&nbsp;

I am a person who focuses on improving personal performance and achieving good results. In daily life you can see that I am:

- acting in a bossy manner

- being compulsive every now and again

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am a person who is sensitive to the needs of others. I look for a compromise when interests are conflicting. In general you can see that I am:

On the other hand I can also be seen as:

&nbsp;

I am someone who is calm and not easily affected or disturbed by external factors. Overall I respond calmly and rationally to stressful and emotional events. In general you can see that I am:
