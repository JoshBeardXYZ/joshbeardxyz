<p>Main idea for the Transmet Email Subscriber Newsletter in 2017: <strong>Quality, not quantity</strong>.</p>

<p>We moved from iContact to <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/pardot/overview/" target="_blank">Pardot</a> to better integrate with Salesforce. I developed new templates to open anywhere and read easily, even in Outlook (<em>shoutout <a href="https://litmus.com/community/templates" target="_blank">Litmus</a></em>). One newsletter a month for one year.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>As Marketing Manager at Transmet Corporation, I took over full control of the Email Marketing program they started in 2013. I had written a lot of copy and assisted with HTML Email Templates in the past, but this would be my first chance to build campaigns from start to finish.</p>

<p>I took the same mobile-friendly approach to Email Development as I saw working in Web Development, and made top-of-the-line email templates using industry pros like Litmus for help.</p>

<p>I was not comfortable sending mass emails to our entire list, unsegmented, without double-opt-in, so I didn’t. Instead, I only mailed to the leads that had interacted with us in the past.</p>

<h3 id="data-validation">Data Validation</h3>

<p>In order to be certain our emails would get delivered to people, I used D&amp;B and Salesforce to Clean and Validate all our data. It’s known that a certain percentage of data goes stale every year and it was important to stay on top of. HuBuCo proved a great resource.</p>
