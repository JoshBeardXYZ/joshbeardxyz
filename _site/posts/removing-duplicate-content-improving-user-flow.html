<p>At the end of 2016, I made three important changes to the Transmet Corporation website. Two of our products had duplicate pages serving the same purpose with the same content. Depending on where a user navigated from, they could see either page.</p>

<p>Not only was this confusing to the user but detrimental to search traffic. I set out to improve the flow of how visitors would learn about our products.</p>

<h2 id="updating-the-products-page">Updating the Products Page</h2>

<p>The Transmet <a href="https://www.transmet.com/products/">Products</a> page was a key page on our site. It was through here that visitors would navigate to more detailed descriptions of each product.</p>

<p>Before, this page was classified by the process used to produce the product (2 methods to produce 4 products). This made sense internally, but to outsiders it was confusing.</p>

<p><strong>Products Page Before</strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/transmet-webpage-all-products-before.png" alt="Transmet Products Page Before" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>To solve this, I displayed all 4 products our company produced, with pictures for each. This was more specific and made more sense than expecting the user to know how each product was produced.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Products Page After</strong></p>

<h2 id="combining-duplicate-pages">Combining Duplicate Pages</h2>

<p>With an updated Products page, it was time to combine the duplicate pages serving the same purpose. The two products below each had two pages displaying duplicate information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.transmet.com/products/zinc-products/zinc-shot/">Cast Zinc Shot Blast Media</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.transmet.com/products/aluminum-products/aluminum-shot/">Cast Aluminum Shot Blast Media</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I completed the necessary redirects and disavows to ensure all traffic would point to one version of each product page.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="traffic-growth-results">Traffic Growth Results</h3>

<p>In 2017 (compared to 2016), pageviews grew:</p>

<ul>
  <li>148% for the Products page</li>
  <li>182% for the Cast Zinc Shot page</li>
  <li>95% for the Cast Aluminum Shot page</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
