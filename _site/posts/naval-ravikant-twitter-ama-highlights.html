<p>Naval Ravikant is a source of truth for me (and an excellent follow on Twitter). Shane Parrish calls him a <em>“deep thinker who challenges the status quo”</em> and this can be felt through his words.</p>

<p>I followed Naval a while back and (<em>thanks to the timeline algo</em>) vastly improved the quality of content on my Twitter feed.</p>

<h2 id="about-naval">About Naval</h2>

<p>Naval is an avid reader and listening to him is almost like reading one hundred books at once <em>(If you have not heard Shane and Naval’s conversation on The Knowledge Project, <a href="https://theknowledgeproject.libsyn.com/naval-ravikant-on-reading-happiness-systems-for-decision-making-habits-radical-honesty">do it now</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>Podcast appearances are rare, but Twitter threads surface frequently. His most recent offered so many thought-provoking tidbits I made this post to save for later.</p>

<p>I picked out some of my favorite responses on advice to younger self, thinking, time vs money, relationships, reading, stress, and health.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
