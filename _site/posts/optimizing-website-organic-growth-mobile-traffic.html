<p>I have always been interested in Website Development and SEO; specifically with Google Search and how to stay relevant. As a small business with one Marketing employee (me), these nuances were not “low-hanging fruit” and frequently fell to the wayside.</p>

<p>However, I always kept my eye on this area and did the bare minimum to stay mobile-friendly and relevant in the eyes of Google.</p>

<p>As an Associate at Transmet Corporation, I informed the IT group of the Google Mobile-Friendly “Mobilegeddon” in 2015, sparking a redesign of the website. This also included a spot of “This Site is Hacked” and finding spam hidden deep in our website code.</p>

<p>After being promoted to Marketing Manager in 2016, I took on increased responsibility for our WordPress website.</p>

<p>I made a point to spend a short period getting our website up to speed with my knowledge. This was not something I did full-time as an Associate and an IT group managed most of it. I narrowed the outline of our site and removed duplicate content to make it easier to read, both by users and by Google.</p>

<p><strong>In the final months of 2016 leading into 2017:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Removed/consolidated duplicate content</li>
  <li>Wrote new page titles and added missing page descriptions with <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast</a></li>
  <li>Revised page structure and added missing title tags</li>
  <li>Submitted Sitemap in Google Search Console</li>
  <li>Compressed/optimized Images and PDFs with <a href="https://shortpixel.com/otp/af/VNJVO5I438769">ShortPixel</a></li>
</ul>
