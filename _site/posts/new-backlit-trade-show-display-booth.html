<p>At the beginning of 2017, after a company rebrand and <a href="https://www.transmet.com/new-logo/" target="_blank">new logo</a>, it was time to update the trade show display booth in use for over a decade. This booth traveled with our Sales Engineer to 4-5 shows every year and sees thousands of show attendees.</p>

<h2 id="before-and-after">Before and After</h2>

<p>Our goal was to focus on the new logo and surround it with product photography. The backlit 8’ x 10’ display would attract the eye more than the charts and text that covered the old booth. Below is a before and after picture of the booth.</p>

<p>This was one of the larger projects I had handled as Marketing Manager at Transmet Corporation and I could not have done it without my project partners.</p>
