<p>I found this tool on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/personal-user-guide">Product Hunt</a> that helps you create a Personal User Guide to help others get along with you better. According to Gijs Heerkens, “the objective of a personal user guide is to speed up trust and effective communication in your life. At your work, for job applications or during job interviews. And, why not, at home, with your partner, your friends or within your sports team.”</p>
