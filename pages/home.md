**Hi, I'm Josh Beard, VP at JPMorganChase • Product Manager, Sales and Marketing • Leo's Dad • Columbus, OH.**  

&nbsp;

As a Product Manager in Sales and Marketing, I leverage ten years of B2B marketing experience to deliver innovative and effective solutions for partners in Global Banking. 

I manage the Marketing Automation Platform, which enables our partners to create and execute personalized and targeted campaigns across multiple channels. I work hands-on with Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) and other marketing technologies, to optimize the performance and efficiency of our processes and capabilities. 

I am passionate about digital transformation and continuous improvement, and I constantly seek new ways to improve our product quality. I operate autonomously with a high level of integrity, and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions for our business.
