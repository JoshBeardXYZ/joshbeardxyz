Hi, I'm Josh Beard. As a Vice President and Product Manager at JPMorgan Chase & Co., I leverage my 10 years of B2B marketing experience to deliver innovative and effective solutions for our Commercial&nbsp;Banking&nbsp;partners. 

I manage the Marketing Automation Platform product, which enables our partners to create and execute personalized and targeted campaigns across multiple channels. I work hands-on with Salesforce Marketing&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;(SFMC) and other marketing technologies, to optimize the performance and efficiency of our marketing processes and&nbsp;systems. 

I am passionate about digital transformation and continuous improvement, and I constantly seek new ways to improve our product quality. I operate autonomously with a high level of integrity, and I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions for our&nbsp;business.
